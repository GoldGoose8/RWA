## Emergency Procedures

### Circuit Breaker Activation
1. Verify the reason for activation
2. Document the circumstances
3. Assess market conditions
4. Make manual reset decision based on assessment
5. If reset, monitor closely for repeated triggers

### Excessive Drawdown
1. Reduce position sizes by 50%
   ```bash
   python scripts/adjust_risk.py --reduce-position-size 0.5
   ```
2. Tighten stop losses
   ```bash
   python scripts/adjust_risk.py --tighten-stops 0.5
   ```
3. Increase circuit breaker sensitivity
   ```bash
   python scripts/adjust_risk.py --circuit-breaker-threshold 0.03
   ```
4. Document actions taken
5. Monitor closely for recovery

### API Failures
1. Verify fallback mechanisms are working
2. Check API provider status pages
3. Switch to backup API if available
   ```bash
   python scripts/switch_api.py --provider backup
   ```
4. Reduce trading frequency if needed
5. Document incident and resolution
