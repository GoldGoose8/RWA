## Prerequisites

Before running the system, make sure you have the following:

1. Python 3.8+ installed
2. Required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install httpx pandas numpy plotly pyyaml streamlit solana
   ```
3. API keys for:
   - Birdeye API
   - Helius API
   - Jito RPC (optional for dry run)

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: End-to-End Simulation Test (Dry Run)

This step simulates the entire flow from token detection to virtual execution without making any real transactions.

1. Check dependencies first:
   ```bash
   ./check_dependencies.py
   ```
   This will verify that all required Python packages are installed and provide instructions for installing any missing packages.

2. Set your API keys in `run_simulation_test.sh`:
   ```bash
   export BIRDEYE_API_KEY="your_birdeye_api_key"
   export HELIUS_API_KEY="your_helius_api_key"
   export JITO_RPC_URL="https://jito-api.example.com"
   export FALLBACK_RPC_URL="https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
   ```

3. Run the simulation test:
   ```bash
   ./run_simulation_test.sh
   ```

4. Expected outputs:
   - `output/token_opportunities.json`: Detected tokens from Birdeye
   - `output/active_launches.json`: Active token launches from Pump.fun
   - `output/whale_opportunities.json`: Whale activities from Helius
   - `output/signals.json`: Sample trading signals
   - `output/enriched_signals.json`: Enriched signals with metadata
   - `output/execution_log.txt`: Simulated execution logs
   - `output/tx_history.json`: Simulated transaction history

5. Verify the simulation results:
   ```bash
   ./verify_simulation.py
   ```
   This will check all output files and verify that they contain valid data.

6. The script will also launch a Streamlit dashboard at http://localhost:8501 for visualization.

### Step 2: Live Execution Prep (After Successful Dry Run)

1. Configure a funded wallet in `wallet_sync/`
2. Update `tx_builder.py` to use the correct keypair
3. Set `DRY_RUN=false` in `launch_all.sh`
4. Run the full system:
   ```bash
   ./launch_all.sh
   ```

### Step 3: Live Trade Test on Test Tokens

1. Monitor the dashboard for new token opportunities
2. Adjust risk parameters in `core/signal_enricher.py`
3. Let the system execute trades automatically
4. Analyze execution performance and PnL

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Check logs in the `output/` directory
- Monitor the dashboard for real-time updates
- Use `kill <PID>` to stop the dashboard process when needed

## Troubleshooting

- If API calls fail, check your API keys and rate limits
- If the dashboard doesn't launch, ensure Streamlit is installed
- If transactions fail, check wallet balance and RPC connection

## Security Notes

- Never commit API keys or private keys to version control
- Use environment variables or secure key management
- Test with small position sizes before scaling up

## Next Steps

After successful testing, consider:
1. Containerizing with Docker
2. Setting up monitoring with Grafana/Prometheus
3. Implementing the RL agent integration
4. Deploying to a VPS for 24/7 operation
