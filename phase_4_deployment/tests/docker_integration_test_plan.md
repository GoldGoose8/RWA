# Docker Integration Test Plan for PyO3 Extension

This document outlines the test plan for verifying the Docker integration of the PyO3 extension in both development and production environments.

## Test Environments

### Development Environment
- Local Docker installation
- Docker Compose with override file
- Development mode with debugging enabled
- Source code mounted as volumes
- Fallback mechanism enabled

### Production Environment
- Local Docker installation simulating production
- Standard Docker Compose configuration
- Production mode with optimizations
- Code bundled in the image
- Fallback mechanism disabled

## Test Categories

### 1. Build Tests
- Verify that the Docker image builds successfully
- Check that the PyO3 extension is compiled correctly
- Ensure that the multi-stage build process works as expected
- Validate that the image size is reasonable

### 2. Runtime Tests
- Verify that the container starts successfully
- Check that the PyO3 extension is loaded correctly
- Ensure that the fallback mechanism works when needed
- Validate that the health checks are functioning

### 3. Functionality Tests
- Test keypair generation and management
- Verify transaction creation and signing
- Test serialization and deserialization
- Ensure that the PyO3 extension performs better than the fallback

### 4. Integration Tests
- Test integration with Helius API
- Verify integration with Birdeye API
- Test end-to-end transaction flow
- Ensure that the system works with real-world data

### 5. Stress Tests
- Test with high transaction volume
- Verify memory usage under load
- Check CPU usage under load
- Ensure that the system remains stable under stress

### 6. Failure Recovery Tests
- Test recovery from PyO3 extension failure
- Verify fallback to solders implementation
- Check recovery from network failures
- Ensure that the system can restart after crashes

## Test Execution

Each test will be executed in both development and production environments, and the results will be compared to ensure consistency.

### Test Procedure
1. Set up the test environment
2. Execute the test script
3. Verify the results
4. Clean up the environment

### Test Reporting
- Pass/Fail status for each test
- Detailed logs for failures
- Performance metrics for comparison
- Recommendations for improvements

## Test Scripts

The following test scripts will be used to execute the tests:

1. `test_docker_build.sh`: Tests the Docker image build process
2. `test_docker_runtime.sh`: Tests the Docker container runtime
3. `test_pyo3_functionality.sh`: Tests the PyO3 extension functionality
4. `test_integration.sh`: Tests integration with external services
5. `test_stress.sh`: Tests the system under load
6. `test_failure_recovery.sh`: Tests recovery from failures

## Success Criteria

The Docker integration will be considered successful if:

1. The Docker image builds successfully in both environments
2. The PyO3 extension loads and functions correctly
3. The fallback mechanism works when the PyO3 extension is unavailable
4. The system performs better with the PyO3 extension than with the fallback
5. The system remains stable under load
6. The system can recover from failures

## Test Schedule

1. Development Environment Tests: Day 1
2. Production Environment Tests: Day 2
3. Comparison and Analysis: Day 3
4. Documentation and Reporting: Day 4
